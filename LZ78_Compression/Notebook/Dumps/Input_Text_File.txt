Who Am I? Why Am I? In philosophy, the Upanishads are Sanskrit texts with 
central concern to discover the relations between cosmic realities, consciousness 
and the human body or person, postulating Atman and Brahman as the summit of 
the interconnected universe. Brahman connotes the highest universal principle, 
the Ultimate Reality of the universe. Atman is the true or eternal Self or the self 
existent essence within each individual. The Bhagavad Gita summarizes the key 
philosophies of the Upanishads with a major focus on the philosophy of karma.
